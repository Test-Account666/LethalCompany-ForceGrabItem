# Force Grab Item Mod<br>

This mod breaks some laws of physics to allow you to grab items that are stuck behind InteractTriggers.<br>

Ever had a troll put a bee hive inside the charger?<br>
No?<br>
Oh...<br>
But I'm sure you had a friend dying right at the main entrance and couldn't pick up his items!<br>
No again?<br>
Well... Umm, this is embarrassing...<br>

It's not a very common issue, but it bugged me personally since I started playing Lethal Company, so I finally fixed
it.<br>
Oh... Have i mentioned that this mod should also allow you to grab items though door triggers?<br>
No? Well, now I have :)<br>

(This means you now won't have issues with accidentally closing doors when grabbing items inside door frames)<br>

**NOTE:
** [HydratedDragon's BetterItemHandling](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/HydratedDragon/BetterItemHandling/)
is supported! :)<br>
Yes, I have a note **add**iction<br>
Not funny? Sorry, I'll stop...<br>
